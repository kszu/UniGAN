        <h1>What is UniGAN?</h1>
        <p>
            UniGAN was built in 2020 to solve two problems: <br /><br />
            1) Consumers want traditionally-gendered products to reflect the gender fluid world that they now live in. <br>
            2) Corporations produce millions of tons of clothing waste each year, driven by many SKUâ€™s and product lines. <br /><br />
            
            "Cultural attitudes and gender ideologies frequently regard women as subordinate to men, or dictate that 
            men should control women. These attitudes may be so widely and deeply held within the community that 
            they are almost invisible - except in their effects. For they perpetuate discrimination, violence and humiliation."
            - Navi Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. <br /><br />

        <h4>
            Enter UniGAN, the world's first unisex design generating product.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Built for product designers and developers, UniGAN leverages cutting edge machine learning technology 
            to combat gender bias at the origin of product development. Inclusivity is a win-win for consumers and 
            corporations alike. Consumers express their gender as they see fit; companies 
            reduce inventory and corporate waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            UniGAN is part of a larger effort to make consumer products inclusive and accessible first and foremost. 
            By beginning with unisex design, product developers will help decrease toxic gender norms 
            while also fighting corporate waste.

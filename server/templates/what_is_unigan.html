        <h1>What is UniGAN?</h1>
        <p>
            UniGAN was built in 2020 to solve two problems: <br>
            1) Consumers want traditionally-gendered products to reflect the gender fluid world that they now live in. <br>
            2) Corporations produce millions of tons of clothing waste each year, driven by many SKUâ€™s and product lines.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Enter UniGAN, the world's first SOMETHING product.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Built for product designers and developers, UniGAN leverages cutting edge machine learning technology 
            to combat gender bias at the origin of product development. Inclusivity is a win-win for consumers and 
            corporations alike. Consumers express their gender as they see fit; companies 
            reduce inventory and corporate waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            UniGAN is part of a larger effort to make consumer products inclusive and accessible first and foremost. 
            By beginning with unisex design, product developers will help decrease toxic gender norms 
            while also fighting corporate waste.
